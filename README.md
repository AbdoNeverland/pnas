# PNAS (Phone Number Authentication System)

PNAS is a web application designed to provide developers with a RESTful API for phone number verification. Developers can sign up to use the API and integrate it into their applications to verify the authenticity of phone numbers provided by users.

## Features

- **Phone Number Verification**: Verify the authenticity of phone numbers provided by users.
- **RESTful API**: Easy-to-use API endpoints for integrating phone number verification into applications.
- **Developer Friendly**: Simple signup process for developers to start using the API.

## Getting Started

To get started with PNAS, follow these steps:

1. **Register**: go to pnas website, and create a new account (the website needs a valid phone number)

2. **Activate your account**: once registed, a verification code will be sent to your phone, enter the digits to activate your account

that's it, now you can use the pnas API
